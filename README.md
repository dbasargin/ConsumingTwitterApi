# ConsumingTwitterApi

This is a practice project I have created to learn and consuming Twitters API.
I am using ASP.NET, json, WebRequests, and access_token technologies at this time 
to accomplish this.

After signing up for twitters and creating a twitter webb app, I got he the credentials I
needed to consume Tweets into my application.

Currently, I have consumed a single tweet from my own twitter account and displayed it on
the UI.

TO DO ITEMS:

1) learn deeper understanding of User and Tweet object models by
   using Json Deserialize feature to turn API Responses into custom 
   objects in my application.
   
2) Display List of Tweets on UI.

3) consume and display other users tweets.

4) To be determined.
