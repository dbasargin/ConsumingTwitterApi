# ConsumingTwitterApi

This is a practice project I have created to learn and consuming Twitters API.
I am using ASP.NET,QuickType.IO, json, WebRequests, and access_token technologies at this time 
to accomplish this.

After signing up for twitters and creating a twitter webb app, I got he the credentials I
needed to consume Tweets into my application.

Currently: The home page will display the POTUS three latest tweets.
            THere is also a search feature that allows the user to enter a screenName from a public profile
            and if the search succeeds it will display that accounts three latest tweets to the UI.

TO DO ITEMS:

1) make UI more attractive(done but will add more for fun)
