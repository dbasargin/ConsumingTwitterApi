# ConsumingTwitterApi and Google Maps API

This is a practice project I have created to learn more about Api's.
I am using an ASP.NET web app to display my successful interactions with Twitter and Google Maps Api's.

Twitter API: 
           Technology: 
           QuickType.IO, Json, WebRequests, and access_token technologies

           Details:
           After signing up for Twitter and creating a Twitter webb app, I got the credentials I
           needed to consume Tweets into my application.

           The home page displays the POTUS three latest tweets.
           There is also a search feature that allows the user to enter a screen name from a public profile
           and if the search succeeds, the UI will display the accounts three latest tweets.


Google Maps API: 
            Technology:
            Javascript
            
            Details:
            Added a new page to the application which displays a Google map to the UI.
            The map initially focuses on the South Puget Sound with scrolling and zooming enabled.
            I also added markers and info windows to Tacoma and Seattle to practice interacting with
            this Api.


TO DO ITEMS:

1) improve UI by adding Javascript features to GoogleAPI Page
2) think of a fun UI interaction feature for this API(maybe a search feature)

Finished/Learned items
- added multiple scripts to ScriptBundles- made available to web pages
- Learned and added Google Maps Api in Javascript
- added a clock and date to navigation bar using Javascript for UI purposes: in effort to learn Javascript
- Created a search feature for public Twitter accounts that consumes their three latest tweets
- (QuickType.IO) helped me learn deeper understanding of user and tweet object models by
   using Json Deserialize feature to turn API responses into custom 
   objects in my application.
- learning API by navigating through API data dictionary
- OAuth (sending credentials to TwitterAPI and receiving Access_token)
- sending web requests to API
- consuming and converting API Responses to C# code 
- Display list of Tweets on UI.
- Creating a Twitter App
- exposure to NewtontonSoft.Json library
- Encoding.UTF8 with access keys from Twitter
