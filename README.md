# ConsumingTwitterApi and Google Maps API

This is a practice project I have created to learn more about Api's.
I am using an ASP.NET web app to display my successful interactions with Twitter and Google Maps Api's.

Twitter API: 
           Technology: 
           QuickType.IO, Json, WebRequests, and access_token technologies

           Details:
           After signing up for twitters and creating a twitter webb app, I got the credentials I
           needed to consume Tweets into my application.

           The home page displays the POTUS three latest tweets.
           THere is also a search feature that allows the user to enter a ScreenName from a public profile
           and if the search succeeds it will display the accounts three latest tweets to the UI.


Google Maps API: 
            Technology:
            Javascript
            
            Details:
            Added a new page to the application which displays a Googke map to the UI.
            The map initially focuses on the South Puget Sound with scrolling and zooming enabled.
            I also added markers and infoWindows to Tacoma and Seattle to practice interacting with
            this Api.


TO DO ITEMS:

1) add some other unique UI feature to GoogleAPI Page
2) think of a fun UI interaction feature for this API(maybe a search feature)

Finished/Learned items
- add multiple scripts to ScriptBundles made available on my web pages
- Learned and added Google Maps Api in Javascript
- added a clock and date to Nav bar using javascript for UI purposes: javascript is new to me.
- Created a search feature for Public Twitter Accounts that gets there last three tweets
- (QuickType.IO) helped me learn deeper understanding of User and Tweet object models by
   using Json Deserialize feature to turn API Responses into custom 
   objects in my application.

- OAuth (sending credentials to TwitterAPI and receiving Access_token)
- sending web requests to API
- consuming and converting API Responses to C# code 
- Display list of Tweets on UI.
- Creating a Twitter App
