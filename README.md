# ConsumingTwitterApi

This is a practice project I have created to learn and consuming Twitters API.
I am using ASP.NET, json, WebRequests, and access_token technologies at this time 
to accomplish this.

After signing up for twitters and creating a twitter webb app, I got he the credentials I
needed to consume Tweets into my application.

Currently, I have consumed a single tweet from my own twitter account and displayed it on
the UI.

TO DO ITEMS:

1) learn deeper understanding of User and Tweet object models by
   using Json Deserialize feature to turn API Responses into custom 
   objects in my application.
   
2) make UI more attractive

3) To be determined: Figure out something useful or interesting to do with Tweets


Finished/LEARNED:

- learning API by navigating through API data dictionary
- OAuth (sending credentials to TwitterAPI and receiving Access_token)
- sending web requests to API
- consuming and converting API Responses to C# code 
- Display list of Tweets on UI.
- Creating a Twitter App
- exposure to NewtontonSoft.Json library
- Encoding.UTF8 with access keys from Twitter
